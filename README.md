# Vietnam Interest Rates - Loan Interest Comparison Application

An application helping users easily compare loan interest rates between banks in Vietnam, calculate loan costs, and provide AI analysis.

## Key Features

- Calculate and compare loan interest rates between banks
- Detailed loan analysis with AI
- Save calculation history
- Support for various loan types (home, vehicle, consumer loans...)
- Options for repayment methods and early repayment

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- Yarn
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for mobile version)

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create an `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and fill in the necessary information:

```
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Running the Application

### Web Version (Next.js)

```bash
yarn web
```

### Mobile Version (Expo)

```bash
yarn native
```

## Project Structure

The project uses a monorepo architecture with the following main structure:

- `apps/`
  - `expo/` - Mobile application (React Native + Expo)
  - `next/` - Web application (Next.js)
- `packages/`
  - `app/` - Common logic, screens, features
  - `ui/` - UI components
  - `config/` - Configs tamagui
  - `supabase/` - Supabase connections and queries

## Technologies Used

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/) - UI framework for both React and React Native
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Backend as a Service
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - AI analysis

```sh
npm create tamagui
```

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is a starter for an Expo + Next.js + Tamagui + Solito app.

Many thanks to [@FernandoTheRojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for the Solito starter monorepo which this was forked from. Check out his [talk about using expo + next together at Next.js Conf 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lnbdRweJtA).

## üì¶ Included packages

- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) ü™Ñ
- [solito](https://solito.dev) for cross-platform navigation
- Expo SDK
- Next.js
- Expo Router

## üóÇ Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native)
- `next` (web)

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `ui` includes your custom UI kit that will be optimized by Tamagui
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

> [!TIP]
> Switching from `app` to `pages` router:
>
> - remove `app` folder from `apps/next`
> - move `index.tsx` from `pages-example` to `pages` folder
> - rename `pages-example-user` to `user` and be sure to update `linkTarget` in `screen.tsx` to `user` as well
> - delete `SwitchRouterButton.tsx` component and remove it from `screen.tsx` and `packages/ui/src/index.tsx`
> - search for `pagesMode` keyword and remove it

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`

To run with optimizer on in dev mode (just for testing, it's faster to leave it off): `yarn web:extract`. To build for production `yarn web:prod`.

To see debug output to verify the compiler, add `// debug` as a comment to the top of any file.

- Expo local dev: `yarn native`

## UI Kit

Note we're following the [design systems guide](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/design-systems) and creating our own package for components.

See `packages/ui` named `@my/ui` for how this works.

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

## Update new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

You may potentially want to have the native module transpiled for the next app. If you get error messages with `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, you may need to use `transpilePackages` in your `next.config.js` and add the module to the array there.

### Deploying to Vercel

- Root: `apps/next`
- Install command to be `yarn set version stable && yarn install`
- Build command: leave default setting
- Output dir: leave default setting
